# Android Banking Application

This Android application was developed using Java, XML and SQLite. It is a banking application which allows a user to create an account, login, check balances and transfer money between accounts. An SQLite database is used to store user details. Concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism and parameter passing were used. Furthermore, the SQLiteOpenHelper and SQLiteCursor classes were used to manage the SQLite database.
